# CSE111-Project
We will be developing a GUI for a website that allows you to take surveys to determine a car that fits for you and a profile to save your results.
Our goal is to use PHP for the backend and front end with the help of Sqllite3 to communicate with the database and XAMPP to help host it locally.  
We will put the database on phpmyadmin and be able to test all sql queries on there as well.
